# Learning Log

Notes on what I learned while building JobLens, one entry per milestone.

## 0 — Foundation

Set up the uv package (`src/` layout), `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, license and a
smoke test. `pyproject.toml` says what the project wants (dependencies as ranges);
`uv.lock` records exactly what was installed, so every machine gets the same versions.

## 1.1 — First LLM call by hand

Built `joblens.llm.raw_client.chat()`: one HTTP POST with httpx, no SDK.

**An LLM call is just HTTP + JSON.** Every OpenAI-compatible provider accepts
`POST {base_url}/chat/completions` with a model name and a list of messages, and
replies with the answer in `choices[0].message.content`.

**Messages and roles.** `system` sets the behaviour ("answer briefly, in Dutch"),
`user` is the question, `assistant` is a previous model reply.

**The API is stateless.** The model remembers nothing between calls. A "conversation"
is the client sending the whole message history again on every call — which also
means longer chats cost more input tokens each turn.

**Tokens.** Models read and write tokens (word pieces), and providers bill per token.
`usage` splits them into `prompt_tokens` (input) and `completion_tokens` (output).

**Reasoning ("thinking").** qwen3 can think before answering. The thinking comes back
in a separate `reasoning` field (DeepSeek calls it `reasoning_content`) and counts as
output tokens. On Ollama, `reasoning_effort: "none"` switches it off.

Measured with `scripts/raw_call.py "Wat is een vacature?"` (qwen3:8b, warm model):

| Thinking | Output tokens | Latency |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| off      | 23            | ~0.27 s |
| on       | 207           | ~2.3 s  |

Same quality of answer for a simple question, ~9x the tokens and time. For extraction
we keep thinking off.

**Temperature.** At 0 the model always picks the most likely next token, so the same
prompt gives the same answer (two runs: identical 23-token replies). Extraction wants
that predictability.

**Other observations.**
- The first call after ~5 idle minutes took 6.6 s: Ollama had unloaded the model and
  had to load it again (cold start).
- Thinking off added 6 hidden input tokens (54 vs 48) — the chat template changes the
  prompt behind the scenes.
